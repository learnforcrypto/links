	For bulletproofs, the real cause for celebration is perhaps that developers don't seem to have found any issues with it. Speaking to CoinDesk, anonymous researcher for the Monero Research Lab, Surang Noether described bulletproofs as a "net win on all fronts" for cryptocurrency.
	Echoing that sentiment, Bunz told CoinDesk:
	 "It's just better. It's shorter, more efficient, three times faster – it's better than the old system in every way."

Info about ZenCash's zk-Starks?
They do multiple things:

1) They encrypt all traffic in a tor-like manner without actually using Tor; it creates world's most censorship resistant network for the user.
2) decentralization. This one is tricky because if ZEN's price skyrockets and nodes become inaccessible financially this property will be lost.
3) censorship resistance once again, but for the network as a whole.

"Blockchain ist überholt" Robert Küfner
Since April my stance on the blockchain changed essentially. We are at a point where Blockchain is readily developed. The future is the Tangle of IOTA - here we reached a breakthrough. It will disrupt everything in the real world, but also in the crypto realm. Even if Amazon [would] accept Bitcoin to jump on the bandwagon because it's cool, Bitcoin would not achieve the goal of a cryptocurrency. The blockchain is outdated. Because with the IOTA tangle, there is a technology that making the blockchain obsolete in a foreseeable timeframe. [All] problems of the blockchain are excellently solved by the tangle."
